What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 

A new repository is made, with untracked history since there are no changes, and no commits (initial commit)

You need to create the repository because it adds the hidden meta files like .git, that makes it different from normal files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 

The staging area is the intermediate step between the working directory and the repository. It's like the middle man.

You put files in that you want to commit from the working directory, and when you're ready, you commit them to the repository.

If you decide not to commit, you don't have to delete it from repository and just from the staging area. You can make sure you are making logical commits.
